# bv-loader-health-extension
Welcome! This is a React-based chrome extension meant to be used internally by folks at BV, as well as by clients in a potential future. It's useful for debugging and seeing the overall health of Bazaarvoice content on a given page, from resources to global namespaces to analytics and more.
